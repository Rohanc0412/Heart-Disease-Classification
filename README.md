# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using clinical and demographic data. This solution supports early diagnosis, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs through timely medical intervention.

---

## Project Overview

Heart disease is a major global health concern. This project uses classification models to detect the presence of heart disease from attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, chest pain type, and more. The dataset used is the well-known Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.

The model helps answer a binary question: **Does the patient show signs of heart disease? (Yes/No)**

---

## Business Value

- **Early Risk Detection**: Helps doctors identify high-risk individuals early.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Acts as a digital assistant in diagnostics.
- **Data-Driven Insight**: Reveals the most influential health indicators.
- **Scalable Screening Tool**: Can be deployed in hospitals or remote diagnostic centers.
